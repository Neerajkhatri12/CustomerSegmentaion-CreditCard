Customer Segmentation of Credit Card Users

Project Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using a dataset of credit card users. The goal is to group customers based on their spending behavior and patterns to derive actionable insights. Businesses can use this segmentation to improve customer targeting, optimize resources, and design tailored marketing strategies.

Key Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and outliers in the dataset.

Preprocess the data to prepare it for clustering algorithms.

Apply the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to identify distinct customer segments.
